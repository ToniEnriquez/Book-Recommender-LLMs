# Book-Recommender-LLMs
A Book-Recommender created using Python, OpenAI, HuggingFace Zero-Shot, LangChain and Gradio. 

Required: Open AI API key - you must add credits into your account in order for it to run.
I recommend using PyCharm as it comes with the HuggingFace interface for you to cache up the models you can use in the future.

1. Text data cleaning (code in the notebook data-exploration.ipynb)
2. Semantic (vector) search and how to build a vector database (code in the notebook vector-search.ipynb). This allows users to find the most similar books to a natural language query (e.g., "a book about a person seeking revenge").
3. Doing text classification using zero-shot classification in LLMs (code in the notebook text-classification.ipynb). This allows us to classify the books as "fiction" or "non-fiction", creating a facet that users can filter the books on.
4. Doing sentiment analysis using LLMs and extracting the emotions from text (code in the notebook sentiment-analysis.ipynb). This will allow users to sort books by their tone, such as how suspenseful, joyful or sad the books are.
5. Creating a web application using Gradio for users to get book recommendations (code in the file gradio-dashboard.py).
